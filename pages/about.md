Hi there.. [CV](https://joshua-roldan.github.io/Joshua_CV_01182023.pdf)

Welcome! Please, make yourself comfortable. 
"Mi (virtual) casa es tu (virtual) casa." 

Just so you know, this website is my personal experiment with publically disclosing aspects from my two lives: 1) my life as a researcher, and 2) my life as a ... (let's call it)... a nomad. My research, in simplistic terms, uses geometry to figure out how the brain computes information. My primary objective is to earn admittance into a PhD program. An unintended consequence of this academic pursuit has been me moving around.
