Hi there! [CV](https://github.com/joshua-roldan/joshua-roldan.github.io/blob/3e1bf02b58a9f61c7b1d61aa42b553b0a672f453/Joshua_Roldan_CV.pdf)
Hi there.. [CV](https://joshua-roldan.github.io/Joshua_Roldan_CV.pdf)

I'm Paul. Iâ€™m a physics major turned programmer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for physics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Check out [my personal website](https://www.lenpaul.com/) for more information on my other projects (including more Jekyll themes!), as well as some of my writing.
