Hi there! [CV](https://github.com/joshua-roldan/joshua-roldan.github.io/blob/3e1bf02b58a9f61c7b1d61aa42b553b0a672f453/Joshua_Roldan_CV.pdf)
Hi there.. [CV1](https://joshua-roldan.github.io/Joshua_Roldan_CV.pdf)

Welcome! Please, make yourself comfortable. Mi (virtual) casa es tu (virtual) casa. Just so you know, this website is my personal experiment with publically disclosing aspects from my two lives: 1) my life as a researcher, and 2) my life as a ... (let's call it)... a nomad. My research, in simplistic terms, uses geometry to figure out how the brain computes information. My primary objective is to earn admittance into a PhD program. As a unintended consequence in achieving this goal, I have moved around.
